<blockquote>
<p>
Emacs Lisp is a fundamentally sequential language, and relies heavily on
side-effects to a global state. Yet, its use in an interactive program has
inevitably lead to a desire for concurrency to try and improve responsiveness.
Concurrency appeared very early on: since Emacs 16.56, Emacs has included
support for asynchronous processes, that is, the execution of separate programs
whose output was processed by so-called process filters whenever the Emacs Lisp
execution engine is idly waiting for the next user input.
</p>

<p>
While this very limited form of cooperative concurrency was slightly improved in
1994’s Lucid Emacs 19.9 and 1996’s Emacs 19.31 by adding native support for
timers (timers had earlier been implemented as an asynchronous process sending
Emacs output at the requested time), it has been the only form of concurrency
available for most of Emacs’s life.
</p>

<p>
Adding true shared-memory concurrency to Emacs Lisp is problematic because of
the pervasive reliance on shared state in existing Emacs Lisp code. In some
cases, shared state is not a problem and concurrency can be mimicked via
asynchronous programming: When a program waits for an operation (such as an
external program), instead of blocking, it registers a continuation callback and
returns control to the main event loop. Yet many Emacs Lisp packages instead
block, because slicing the execution via callbacks means effectively writing
code in continuation-passing style which is poorly supported in Emacs Lisp,
interacts badly with dynamic scoping, and requires significant surgery to
retro-fit to existing code.
</p>

<p>
So, shared-memory concurrency was largely considered as inapplicable to Emacs
Lisp. Never- theless, in November 2008, Giuseppe Scrivano posted a first naive
attempt at adding threads to Emacs Lisp. This effort did not go much further,
but it inspired Tom Tromey to try his own luck. Proc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol.
4, No. HOPL, Article 74. Publication date: June 2020.74:44 Stefan Monnier and
Michael Sperber
</p>

<p>
In 2010, he started to work on adding shared-memory cooperative concurrency
primitives like make-thread to Emacs. Interaction with the implementation of
dynamic scoping, which is based on a global state for speed, required
experimentation with various approaches. Correctly handling buffer-local and
frame-local bindings without a complete rewrite was particularly painful and
most approaches were abandoned simply because it was too difficult to keep them
up-to-date with the evolving Emacs codebase.
</p>

<p>
A working approach was finally released in 2018, as part of Emacs 26.1. Context
switches still take place only at a few known points where Emacs Lisp is idle
(or via explicit calls to thread-yield). The current implementation of this
feature makes context switches take time proportional to the current stack
depth, because the dynamic bindings of the old thread need to be saved and
removed, after which the dynamic bindings of the new thread need to be restored.
Earlier implementation approaches tried to avoid this expensive form of context
switching by making global variable lookups a bit more expensive instead, but
these would have required more extensive and delicate changes to existing code.
Therefore, while this approach may be reconsidered in the future, the current
implementation favored a simpler and safer approach.
</p>

<p>
The inclusion of such a form of shared-state concurrency was hotly debated
between the main- tainers. They all agreed that Emacs Lisp needs to develop
concurrency and parallelism in order to take advantage of the increasing number
of CPU cores available, especially since single-core performance is not
increasing significantly any more; but there was also a consensus that shared
memory is a very bad fit to the current Emacs Lisp world. Tom Tromey’s patch was
finally accepted only because it was non-invasive, and because there was a
feeling that it was important to do something.
</p>

<p>
This is still a fairly experimental feature, and two years after its appearance,
its use appears to still be limited to experimental patches to a handful of
packages such as the Gnus MUA. Arguably the main outcome so far has been to
expose some latent bugs in some packages’s asynchronous processing.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, other approaches to concurrency and parallelism have been
developed as Emacs Lisp packages, most notably the async.el package [Wiegley
2019] developed in 2012 that runs Emacs Lisp code in parallel in a separate
Emacs subprocess. Its applicability is limited by the fact that the buffers’s
contents need to be explicitly sent as needed between the two processes, forcing
a very coarse grain of parallelism. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the
configuration of the subprocess is consistent with that of the main processÐthe
subprocess may even be another version of Emacs in some cases. Still, several
third party packages make limited use of async.el.

<p>
&gt; Sadly, multithreading is an afterthought for Emacs
</p>


<p>
It is, but it's usable. I'm actually amazed that, even after three major
versions, the built-in threading is not used by the community.
</p>


<p>
Yes, the threads currently are not usable for number crunching in the
background. And yes, there are bugs, and trying to do many things from the
background thread doesn't work, sometimes in unexpected ways. You can still
block the main thread from the background thread since some things block the
event loop, no matter where they were started.
</p>

<p>
But, the threads do give you independent control flows. Whatever you cannot do
in the background, you can offload to the main thread with a timer and a queue
of lambdas.
</p>

<p>
The built-in threads are very, very bare-bones - it's around 15 functions, for
threads, mutexes, and condition variables. They are very limited by their
"mostly cooperative" nature. However, with a bit of sugar, they are usable for
at least one thing: async processes and network communication.
</p>

<p>
In a background thread, you can "block" to wait for a child process to do
something. It's natural and requires no macrology (async.el&#x2026;). The same is
true for network communication. You can block and wait for a response while the
rest of Emacs does whatever. With just two functions, you can write code without
blocking as if you used `call-process`. Sequential actions - call this, wait for
it to finish, call that, wait for it to finish, etc. - can now be coded in a
sequential way, without having to worry about callbacks, sentinels, and a
poor-man FSM implementation that invariably appears in Elisp that doesn't use
threads.
</p>

<p>
The threads built into Emacs, currently, are closer to green threads or
coroutines, functionally, than to OS-level threads. But that's still a huge help
in a bunch of important and pervasive scenarios. It's really strange that nobody
seems to realize this.
</p>

<p>
With threads (as they are), the Continuation Passing Style compiler macro (in
generator.el), and dynamic modules (for actual parallelism where needed) Emacs
now has everything it needs to make it non-blocking by default. Of course, that
would entail rewriting everything on top of these abstractions, so it's
unrealistic - but for new code and packages? I think we're just one package
(along the lines of dash, s, etc.) away from convenient concurrency and
parallelism in Emacs. The problem, of course, is that someone needs to design
and code that package&#x2026;
</p>


<p>
&gt; Anyway, as I see it, the Emacs threads would not help for Affe
</p>

<p>
You're right. I misspoke. I was thinking about the performance of sending large
amounts of data through pipes versus accessing them through shared memory. I
didn't consider the CPU-bound action of filtering the data. As we don't get
parallelism with threads, the filtering itself would be most likely slower.
</p>

<p>
&gt; The net positive is that one can run multiple blocking IO operations in
&gt; parallel,
</p>

<p>
First of all, you cannot (in Emacs, I mean), run "multiple blocking operations
in parallel" just because you spawn a new thread. `call-process` and friends
will block the main thread, and therefore the event loop, no matter which thread
they were called from. It's far from the only case where a function invoked from
a background thread will freeze Emacs. :)
</p>

<p>
The threads as they currently are in Emacs <b><b>are basically useless</b></b> for running
"multiple blocking" ops in parallel :D
</p>

<p>
There's more: calling certain other functions from the background thread might
mess up the display. Updating a buffer that's currently displayed in a visible
window can make the display flicker, some modes toggle off and back on, and even
search data might get corrupted.
</p>

<p>
Add the lack of parallelism to this, along with the most bare-bones API
provided, and you get threads that are not just "close to useless", but already
past all redemption :D
</p>

<p>
Or at least threads that cannot be used like "normal" threads would be in other
contexts. But they <b>might be</b> a small part of a layer of library code that would
make async programming convenient in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
&gt; but I think asynchronous, non-blocking IO is widely considered the more
&gt; efficient alternative, but is probably also more complicated.
</p>

<p>
The real problem is that, I think, async and non-blocking programming in Emacs
is incredibly inconvenient. It's a decade past the point where everyone and
their cat decided that coroutines are good, and started implementing them. There
are mature async stacks all around, yet Emacs still asks you to deal with
filters, sentinels, and pipes!, when you want to do something async in the
background.
</p>

<p>
You end up performing CPS transformation on your code by hand, or you build a
giant FSM with a `pcase` of all possible states in some entry-point defun.

<blockquote>
<p>
This function follows a recursive approach, using the sentinel function to
trigger the next command once the current one has finished. Notice that "apply"
is used to pass the rest of the commands to the recursive call. This essentially
unpacks the list of commands so they remain separate function arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
### Refine the above solution. The function will take a variable number of
arguments, as before, but the arguments will be either strings or integers.
String arguments are handled as before, but when encountering a number, the
function should wait a specified number of seconds before continuing with the
next argument.
</p>

<p>
Pseudocode:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create the function: (defun my-shell-command-async (&amp;rest commands)</li>
<li>If the list of commands is empty, return nil.</li>
<li>Given a command from the list:</li>
<li>If the command is a string, use start-process-shell-command, providing it with a unique process name, nil for the buffer (we don't need to see output), and the command. Set the sentinel of the process to this function, similar as before.</li>
<li>If the command is a number, use (run-with-timer) function, providing it with the delay value equals to command and 
a. Define a timer function that recursively call my-shell-command-async with the rest of the commands.
b. Pass the lambda function as a timer function to (run-with-timer) function.</li>
<li>Return the process object.</li>

<p>
In the revised version, `(cond)` function is used to distinguish if command is a
string or a number. If command is a string, build and run a process same as
before. If command is a number, use `run-at-time` function to create a timer.
`run-at-time` function takes time delay and a function to execute after delay as
arguments. Here, `(apply 'my-shell-command-async (cdr commands))` is passed as
function to run after delay. It calls `my-shell-command-async` recursively with
rest of the commands.
